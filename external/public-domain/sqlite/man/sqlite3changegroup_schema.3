.Ft int
.Fo sqlite3changegroup_schema

.Sh DESCRIPTION
This method may be used to optionally enforce the rule that the changesets
added to the changegroup handle must match the schema of database zDb
("main", "temp", or the name of an attached database).
If sqlite3changegroup_add() is called to add a changeset that is not
compatible with the configured schema, SQLITE_SCHEMA is returned and
the changegroup object is left in an undefined state.
.Pp
A changeset schema is considered compatible with the database schema
in the same way as for sqlite3changeset_apply().
Specifically, for each table in the changeset, there exists a database
table with:
.Bl -bullet
.It
The name identified by the changeset, and
.It
at least as many columns as recorded in the changeset, and
.It
the primary key columns in the same position as recorded in the changeset.
.El
.Pp
The output of the changegroup object always has the same schema as
the database nominated using this function.
In cases where changesets passed to sqlite3changegroup_add() have fewer
columns than the corresponding table in the database schema, these
are filled in using the default column values from the database schema.
This makes it possible to combined changesets that have different numbers
of columns for a single table within a changegroup, provided that they
are otherwise compatible.

These declarations were extracted from the
interface documentation at line 11868.
